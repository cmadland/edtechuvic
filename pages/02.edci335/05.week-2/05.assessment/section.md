### :fa-wordpress: Post #2

!!! This post is your second graded assessment for the course and is worth 7% of your final grade.

On your own blog, create a new post and write about what you have learned so far in the course. Remember that [you will be assessed according to the SOLO Taxonomy](https://edtechuvic.madland.ca/edci335/assignments). In the context of your post, this means that you need to demonstrate that you have engaged with the readings, blog posts, videos, and other learning resources and that you have connected the ideas in those resources to your own ideas and experiences.

! I am not looking for a simple summary of the readings. You *MUST* connect the readings to your own ideas.

You are not required to use any particular academic writing style like APA or MLA. A blog post is less formal than academic writing. However, if you use someone else's ideas, you need to acknowledge where those ideas came from. The standard way of doing that in a blog post is to create a link to the resource. Doing this allows people who are reading your post to follow up and learn more about what you are trying to say, and it also is a way of saying thank-you to the person who first published the idea.
