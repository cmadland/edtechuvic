You may be familiar with the challenge that it is to change someone else's mind. If you have ever argued with someone whose beliefs are different from yours, whether they are a friend, or a random stranger on the internet, you likely know that even the strongest arguments against their view, that are utterly convincing for you, seem to make them believe even more strongly that they are correct.

This is because our ideas, regardless of what they are or how truthful they may be, become thoroughly embedded in very strong connections in our brains, and they are *extremely* persistent. Everybody has misconceptions about the world.

Here is a little quiz for you. Don't worry, it's not part of your grade.

How did you do? Did you get it on the first try? If you didn't, you may have given yourself an example of a misconception that you hold about the world.

Here's a short video from Derek Muller of the YouTube channel [Veritasium](https://veritasium.com).

:fa-question: Did you notice Skinner's influence?

These misconceptions about the world, combined with what is known as *confirmation bias*, meaning that we give more credibility to ideas we already agree with, and less credibility to ideas we disagree with, lead to a situation where it is *very* difficult to change someone's mind.

When you think about it though, *learning is changing your mind* about something. That is why learning is difficult. It takes focussed work and effort, like we discussed last week.

Here is another video, this one from Destin Sandlin at [Smarter Every Day](https://smartereveryday.com). As you watch, consider the role of *neuroplasticity* in teaching and learning.
