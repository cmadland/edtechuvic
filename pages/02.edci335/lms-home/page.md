[plugin:content-inject](../home/_important-reminders)

!!!! I apologize for the shifting homepage on this site in the last few days, and for some of you who may have received multiple notifications about the same posts published. I've had a little difficulty getting the feeds sorted properly, but think I have it now!

I'll keep the homepage here for now, but do let me know if you prefer to see something else when you first check the site.

To see updates from either me or your colleagues in the class, click `Updates` in the menu above, then choose either `Learner Posts` or `Instructor Posts`.
