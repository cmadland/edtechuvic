!!!! It looks like the issues with OAC have been resolved! I hope none of you were terribly affected. One of the ever-present challenges with teaching through some sort of mediating technology (video, audio, or even plain text, like here) is that the technology can fail and leave learners stranded. Patience and flexibility are key!

I'll keep the homepage here for now, but do let me know if you prefer to see something else when you first check the site.

To see updates from either me or your colleagues in the class, click `Updates` in the menu above, then choose either `Learner Posts` or `Instructor Posts`.
