[plugin:content-inject](../home/_important-reminders)

!! As of 5:00 am this morning (Thursday, May 16), I've noticed that [onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca](https://onlineacademiccommunity.uvic.ca) is not loading at all. It is likely that your blogs are affected. I have submitted a ticket to [University Systems](https://www.uvic.ca/systems/support/learningteaching/oac/request.php), and you are welcome to do the same.

I'll keep the homepage here for now, but do let me know if you prefer to see something else when you first check the site.

To see updates from either me or your colleagues in the class, click `Updates` in the menu above, then choose either `Learner Posts` or `Instructor Posts`.
