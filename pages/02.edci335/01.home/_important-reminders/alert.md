# PLEASE NOTE!
Updated Friday, June 7.

- I've discovered a discrepancy between the due dates published on the 'Schedule' and the dropbox in CourseSpaces. The first draft of your Interactive Learning Resource is listed as being due this Sunday, June 9 in CourseSpaces, but due next Sunday, June 16 on the schedule.
- If you had planned to complete it this week, that is fine, but you may also submit anytime up until Sunday, June 16.
- This is my error, and I apologize.
