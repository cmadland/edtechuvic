Hello Everyone!

I'll post thoughts and links here on Posts 2-3. I really encourage you to check out some of your colleagues' challenges. You are doing some really cool things!

Check for grades in CourseSpaces.

Alex, I love your idea of teaching yourself coin tricks using a 60 year old book called *Modern Coin Magic*. In post 2 you wondered whether you were engaged in an indirect apprenticeship since you are interacting with Bobo's ideas, and I would argue that you are. Your Khan Academy for magic tricks might be [r/magic on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Magic/).

Great job on your videos!

Hoazhe, thanks for your posts! It looks like you've learned some important lessons about cooking. My daughter often skips steps of recipes too. I would love to see videos of *you* cooking a recipe! How would you take a deep approach to learning to cook?

Gao, you are making me miss curry udon! One of the advantages of video over live demonstrations is that you can review the demo multiple times, and even slow it down if you need to. I'm looking forward to your chicken recipe! Make sure you continue to connect what and how you are learning to the course readings! Would you be willing to share a video of your chicken experience?

Yolanda, thanks for your posts! It's interesting to read about increasing life-expectancy.

Pinrui, thanks for your posts! Getting back into 'shape' is a great target, although you need to be careful to not do too much too soon! That is a good way to get hurt. Physical training is certainly a good reminder that our bodies adapt to how they are used, and that includes our brains!

It's a good idea to use links when you reference other sites on the internet!

Haoming, thank you for your posts! I'd love to hear how your wonton-making went! Learning to play the piano is another great task for the challenge, and a great way to spend time with your friends. It look slike you have some good strategies for learning, like understanding the history of the piano, and getting lots of practice. Will you share a video of your progress?

mmmm...rib-eye and burgers, oh my! (sorry)

Your problem of leaving too much meat stuck to the grill might be solved by having a nice clean grate. My grill has a good quality stainless stell grate and it is great for staying non-stick. I've also started grilling a lower temperature and that helps meat not stick as well. Adding pork will also help! I often use chorizo sausage to add to lean or medium ground beef. Don't use extra-lean...dry and flavourless.

Great job on your posts! I'll be grilling some chicken tonight!

Hi Chloe, thanks for sharing your thoughts with us! Making things interesting and engaging is not only a good strategy for becoming more active, but it also works as a strategy for learning all sorts of things. Doggos make everything better! ...and your garden looks amazing!

I appreciate how you are using featured images on your blog! They make a big difference!

Thanks for your posts Huiyu! Driving a car with a manual transmission is one of the frustrating rites of passage for new (and old) drivers. Good job with sharing your journey so far. I appreciate my car because it has a hill-start assist feature that automatically holds the car from rolling back on a hill.

Xue, thanks for your posts! I appreciate that you say that your learning plan will change based on the week's readings! It looks like your careful planning led to some yummy eggs!

Hey Cooper, stay safe in your travels! I like how you connected the Veritasium video with inflexible culinary tastes! That's a connection I hadn't thought of before.

Jessica, if you made the cookies at the bottom of post #2, those look fantastic! Are the yellow ones icing? You said something interesting in your post:

> For the third time, instead of watching instructional video on Youtube, I connected with my friend video and had her teach me how to make cookies face to face.

This is interesting to me because many people who currently teach in higher ed wouldn't think that a video connection would be considered face-to-face, but you are accustomed to it, so it seems natural.

And thank you for posting your 'failed' chiffon cakes. Although it's not a failure if you can still eat it!

Great posts, Thom! It's cool that Destin's video on the backwards bike resonated so well with your challenge. There are several great iOS and Android apps available that will track a whole load of data for you, if you're interested in such things. I use Strava.

Boyin, thank you for your posts. It would be great if you could share pictures or video of what you are trying to cook. Can you share more about what you are doing to learn to cook?

Jack, your steak looks like a prefect medium-rare! nice job. Your burger looks great too. Thanks for your clear description of your process and some of the challenges you' have faced.
