### Assignment Details

### Personal Learning Challenge/Reflective Practice (Individual) - 5 posts @ 7% = 35%

Beginning in the second week of the course, you will embark on a personal learning challenge where you will challenge yourself to learn a new skill. You are free to identify any safe and legal activity which you would like to learn and you will have four weeks to practice.

Skills which may interest you include:

- playing a musical instrument
- riding a bicycle or unicycle
- juggling
- cooking, baking, or grilling (!) a series of more challenging recipes
- breaking or starting a habit

You are encouraged to complete the learning portion of this activity with other people, either within the class or in your local community. For example, if there are several people who want to learn an instrument, you may want to work together, form a band,

and learn a particular song.

The main point of the activity isn&#39;t for you to become perfectly proficient at your chosen skill, but for you to **experience** the challenges associated with literally changing your brain in order to learn something and then to **reflect** on those challenges and successes to **share** what you have learned with the rest of the class in relation to what you are learning about designing learning experiences.

In order to **reflect** on your experience, you will need to document your learning somehow. Data might include the ratio of successful to unsuccessful attempts, time spent practicing, subjective ratings of confidence in your ability, reports of others related to the quality of your performance, pictures, videos, audio recordings, etc. Once you have gathered some data, look for patterns. What time of day is best for you to practice? Was there a &#39;breakthrough&#39; moment where everything came together? What was most difficult? What was easiest?

Sharing your experience will be based on the data that you gather and will take place on your blog. Please narrate your experience for the rest of the class. Tell us about your process. How did you plan your learning? How did you work through challenges? Is is better to practice alone or with someone else? If you practice with someone else, is it more helpful if they are more skilled than you? Share your data with us! You don&#39;t need to become a YouTube or Instagram influencer through this process, so don&#39;t worry too much if the media you share isn&#39;t sparkly and slickly produced. It is expected that this will be a formative process, meaning you will be really bad at the beginning, and more skilled at the end.

The most important part of this activity is for you to connect your learning process to what you are learning in this class about learning and learning design. It&#39;s all very meta.

### Learning Design Blueprint (Cooperative) - 15%

This assignment is the first component of your Interactive Learning Resource assignment and must be submitted before you submit the Interactive Learning Resource assignment. The blueprint is a cooperative activity which you will complete with the group you formed during Week 1.

[Cooperative learning is explained in greater detail in the course blog](http://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/?page_id=19&amp;preview=true), so make sure you read that before you begin.

In your groups, you need to collectively identify a concept or topic that you want to teach to a group of people. It is strongly recommended that you choose a concept related to your academic major. Once you have identified your concept, you will create a plan for your Interactive Learning Resource, which will be an activity, or series of smaller activities which should take about 1-2 hours to complete. You should divide the work amongst yourselves according to the requirements of the assignment below:

1. A description of your proposed learning resource and rationale for choosing that topic;
2. a concept analysis **(400-500 words)**, including the following:
  1. a concise definition citing at least 2 academic sources
  2. 1-2 examples of the concept
  3. 1-2 non-examples of the concept (mis-conceptions)
  4. 1-3 essential features of the concept (these are features which, if absent, would make the phenomenon a non-example e.g. a triangle must have three sides)
  5. 1-3 accidental features of the concept (these are features, which may or may not be present in the phenomenon e.g. a triangle must have three sides of equal length)

        \*NOTE: the concept analysis may require more than one person to ensure equitable participation.

1. 2-4 learning outcomes related to your concept
\*\*SUGGESTION: identify as many learning outcomes as there are people in your group.
2. a list of sub-topics that form a progression through your lesson
3. a list of resources that your learners will need to access such as:
  1. textbooks (see: [open.bccampus.ca](https://open.bccampus.ca/)),
  2. scholarly articles (accessible through the UVic library)
  3. &#39;grey literature&#39; (professional resources, blogs, videos, etc)
  4. technology tools (WordPress, Etherpad, Moodle, etc)

There are multiple ways you might want to organize this information. Options include a table, a kanban board, a concept map, or another medium that you find more appropriate. The important thing is that the blueprint is easy to access and displays the information you need in a quickly readable format.

### Interactive Learning Resource (Cooperative) - 35%

Your task in this assignment is to create a learning resource related to the topic of your choice (ideally a topic within your academic major). The resource should take approximately 1-2 hours for a learner to complete.

The Learning Design Blueprint assignment is the planning stage of this assignment. **You cannot submit this assignment without first submitting the Learning Design Blueprint and getting feedback from me****.**

Your task here is to use the blueprint to actually create an interactive learning resource in a digital environment. You should presume that you need to teach 15-20 people and that you have 1-2 weeks to do so. Your learners are assumed to be adult professionals who are spread across Canada and come from a variety of ethnic backgrounds.

You will need to turn your Blueprint into an actual learning resource using at least one, and ideally a combination, of the technology tools that we discussed in Week 4. Your learning resource will be reviewed by your peers before you submit it to me during the final week of the course, and they will need to be able to complete the activities as if they were an actual student in your target audience.

You must include the following in your resource:

- An overview of the resource
- 2-4 learning outcomes (copied or revised from your blueprint)
- Brief commentary about each topic and activity
- ne **interactive** activity for each learning outcome/topic based on a resource aligned with that topic (blog post, video, article, etc)
- A bibliography or reference list of all resources cited and/or required for your students;
  - Use whatever citation format you are comfortable with (APA, MLA, etc) but please be consistent throughout.
- The following pages separate from your learning resource
  - A rationale for your technology choices;
  - links to each peer review of your resource
  - a rationale for why you did or did not incorporate your peers recommendations into your final resource

### Group Process Reflection (Individual) - 5%

As a component of your Interactive Learning Resource submission, **each individual** in your group must submit to me a **confidential** reflection on the group process and effectiveness. This reflection will constitute 5 of your grade for the assignment and will be submitted via dropbox in CourseSpaces.

This reflection should be 250-300 words and include discussion of what worked well, what didn&#39;t work and how you would change it, and a grade /5 for yourself and each of your group members in a table format.

I will use the peer and self-assessment grades to determine your grade for this portion of the course.

### Interactive Learning Resource Peer Review (Individual) - 10%

By the end of Week 5 of the course, you will have substantially completed your Interactive Learning Resource as a draft and will have made it available for your colleagues in the class. During Week 6, each of you will act as beta testers for other groups&#39; resources. You will work through the resource as a student and make notes for the group who created the resource so that they may improve the design of their resource prior to submitting it at the end of Week 6.

Your notes and critique should focus on aspects of the resource that will be assessed (appropriate outcomes, alignment, variety of assessment, interactivity, technology use and rationale, presentation, grammar, spelling, citations, etc) and it must be constructive. Do not simply say that &#39;X&#39; is a pre-structural response; offer collegial suggestions for improvement.

Complete your review as a post on your own blog. You must include a link to the resource that you reviewed.



### Due Dates

This course is on a very tight timeline and we need to complete a full 1.5 units in half the time it normally takes to do so. In addition, we don&#39;t have any required class meetings; you are responsible for scheduling your time and work in order to complete the course. As your instructor, there are obligations that I have to UVic with respect to submitting my assessment of your work so that the Department of Curriculum and Instruction and Senate for approval. What this all means is that there is a limited amount of time for you to complete the requirements of this course in order to be granted credit towards your degree.

Within the course schedule, there is limited flexibility regarding when you submit assignments as the assignments are designed to build upon one another, and in the case of the Interactive Learning Resource, the rest of the class is dependent on your work being completed on time so that they can do their work.

You must submit your Learning Design Blueprint **prior** to submitting your Interactive Learning Resource which must be submitted as a draft by the end of week 4 if you want to receive peer review feedback.

If you and/or your group are going to have difficulty submitting assignments by the due date, you **MUST** talk to me ahead of time. Do not wait until the last minute to do so.

### Participation Requirements

Successful completion of this course will be dependent upon your participation in the conversations that happen online, particularly on the course blog at edtechuvic.ca/edci335. You should check the blog at least daily. I will typically post an overview of each week on Monday morning as well as follow-up posts throughout the week. It is recommended that you subscribe to the feed of posts from the course blog so that you will be notified of every new post.

As this is an online course with no scheduled meeting times, there are no &#39;attendance&#39; requirements.

### Department of Curriculum &amp; Instruction Policy on Students&#39; Use of an Editor

We are pleased to allow you to use the following forms of assistance by an editor:

1. **Proofreading** which includes: reviewing work for accuracy of inputting; adherence to a specified design; mechanical or typographic errors in text or formatting; identifying inconsistencies in elements (e.g. headings in APA format); and identifying errors in spelling, punctuation and visual elements

AND

1. **Copy editing** which includes: editing work for grammar, spelling, punctuation, usage and other mechanics of style; reviewing work for consistency of mechanics and internal consistency of facts; indication the hierarchy of heading and placement of art; identifying citation errors; editing captions and credit lines&#39; and editing front matter.

In addition, BUT ONLY WITH WRITTEN PERMISSION OF YOUR INSTRUCTOR, you may seek

Stylistic editing which includes: clarifying meaning; polishing language; querying confusing sentence structures; identifying wrong word choices and ambiguous passages; checking tables, figures and visual materials for clarity; identifying faulty connections and transitions; and/or identifying jargon, redundancies and verbosity.

### Academic Integrity

Students are reminded that they must follow University policies on academic integrity.  Violations of this policy include plagiarism, unauthorized use of an editor, cheating, multiple submission and falsifying materials.  Further details, including penalties, can be found online via the Academic Calendar [https://web.uvic.ca/calendar2019-01/undergrad/info/regulations/academic-integrity.html#](https://web.uvic.ca/calendar2019-01/undergrad/info/regulations/academic-integrity.html%23) Students should consult with their instructors if in doubt about what constitutes a violation of academic integrity.

### Course Experience Survey (CES)

I value your feedback on this course. Towards the end of term, as in all other courses at UVic, you will have the opportunity to complete a confidential survey regarding your learning experience (CES). The survey is vital to providing feedback to me regarding the course and my teaching, as well as to help the department improve the overall program for students in the future. When it is time for you to complete the survey you will receive an email inviting you to do so. Please ensure that your current email address is listed in MyPage. If you do not receive an email invitation, you can go directly to [http://www.uvic.ca/learningandteaching/students/resources/ces/login.php](http://www.uvic.ca/learningandteaching/students/resources/ces/login.php) . You will need to use your UVic netlink ID to access the survey, which can be done on your laptop, tablet, or mobile device. I will remind you and provide you with more detailed information nearer the time but please be thinking about this important activity during the course.

### Sexualized Violence Prevention and Response at UVic

UVic takes sexualized violence seriously, and has raised the bar for what is considered acceptable behaviour. We encourage students to learn more about how the university defines sexualized violence and its overall approach by visiting [www.uvic.ca/svp](http://www.uvic.ca/svp). If you or someone you know has been impacted by sexualized violence and needs information, advice, and/or support please contact the sexualized violence resource office in Equity and Human Rights (EQHR).
