### Interactive Learning Resource Peer Review (Individual) - 10%

By the end of Week 5 of the course, you will have substantially completed your Interactive Learning Resource as a draft and will have made it available for your colleagues in the class. During Week 6, each of you will act as beta testers for other groups&#39; resources. You will work through the resource as a student and make notes for the group who created the resource so that they may improve the design of their resource prior to submitting it at the end of Week 6.

Your notes and critique should focus on aspects of the resource that will be assessed (appropriate outcomes, alignment, variety of assessment, interactivity, technology use and rationale, presentation, grammar, spelling, citations, etc) and it must be constructive. Do not simply say that &#39;X&#39; is a pre-structural response; offer collegial suggestions for improvement.

Complete your review as a post on your own blog. You must include a link to the resource that you reviewed.
