# :fa-question-circle: What is learning?

This is the million dollar question that needs to be answered before we can really talk about learning design. To get you started thinking about what it means to learn, please read the following post from Clarissa Sorenson-Unruh.

You are invited to use [hypothes.is](http://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/hypothes-is/) to annotate this post. Please use the tag `edci335`. Two things you can do are to annotate the page with your questions, and to annotate with connections to your own experience.

### What's going on here?

Using hypothes.is like this to annotate a web resource is a strategy that you can use in any learning situation to enhance the likelihood that your will remember something, otherwise known as `encoding`. By activating multiple regions of your brain, you are actively building new connections between your brain cells. That's what Sorenson-Unruh means when she says

> Learning requires building new synapses in the brain to interconnect bits of information/data. These synapses are gaps (i.e. connections) that form between axons that grow from one neuron (presynaptic) to another neuron (postsynaptic).

The trouble is, if you only do this once, that connection is very weak and it is easily broken. You can strengthen the connection by connecting it to your own past experiences and knowledge, otherwise known as `consolidation`.
