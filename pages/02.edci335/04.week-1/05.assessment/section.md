To wrap up this week, we need to get ready for your [major project](https://edtechuvic.madland.ca/edci335/assignments) for the course, where you will plan, design, and deploy an interactive, online learning experience. To do that well, you will be encouraged to work in cooperative groups of 2-4 people*.
