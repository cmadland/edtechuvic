### :fa-question-circle: How does technology influence teaching?

We are going to dig a little deeper into what teaching (the flip-side of learning) is and how it happens in this topic. You'll read a chapter from an online book, and begin to think about how technology can impact teaching and learning, for better or for worse.

The chapter is linked below, please take a few minutes to read and [annotate](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/hypothesis) as you go. You don't need to read this deeply, but you should have an idea about what `epistemology` is, as well as `objectivism`, `behaviourism`, `cognitivism`, `constructivism`, and `connectivism`.

Did you watch the embedded video of BF Skinner? If not, here it is, it's short, but important. While you watch the video, try to complete the activity below.

### What is going on here?

Educational technology is not new. BF Skinner was singing the praises of his *teaching machine* in the mid 1950s, and his ideas were not new either.
