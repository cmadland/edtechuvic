At this point in your life, you have worked your way through close to 15 years of formal learning environments. Some of you have experienced little more than a typical classroom with learners in rows of desks and a teacher at the front. Others of you have had more varied experiences, perhaps you attended a Science and Technology school with an emphasis on inquiry learning, or maybe an outdoor education school with an emphasis on adventure education, or maybe you were a home-school learner. Whatever the case in your history, you have a variety of experiences from which you can draw.

Use the checklist below to let us know the types of learning environments you grew up with. Once we get some answers, I'll publish the anonymized results.

There are a wide variety of possible learning environments in both F2F and online contexts. You might be familiar with Ferris Bueller's economics teacher in the 1986 movie where the dull, dry, monotone delivery of a lecture is portrayed.

Or, perhaps, you are familiar with this scene from the 1950s, which might be analogous to some teachers who simply throw everything at their learners in a way that is far too fast for their learners to process. Some people also call this method 'drinking from a fire hose'.

### Lucy and Ethel at the Chocolate Factory

Or, for a more technologically enhanced prediction from the early 1900s, there is this image from France.

I hope it is obvious to you that not all teaching and learning environments are actually conducive to learning. Whether a teacher is putting their learners to sleep, or forcing too much content, or trying to rely on a techno-magical solution, there are problems with all of the learning environments shown above.

## Better Learning Design

Rather than focusing on poor learning design, I think it is more beneficial to think about what good learning design looks like. We have encountered some ideas in previous weeks, such as Derek Muller talking about the importance of addressing misconceptions and Destin Sandlin talking about neuroplasticity.

Below are three videos that talk more specifically about designing learning. The videos are admittedly dated, but they are based on the book `Teaching for Quality Learning at University` by John Biggs and Catherine Tang, which is a well-regarded resource for university educators.

The three videos are about 20 minutes long all together.

## :fa-question: What's going on here?

There are three key ideas that I hope you take away from the videos above. First, learning happens because of `what learners DO`. Learning is not about what `teachers` do, or about who learners `are`, but about what learners do. So in this course, on learning design, you are designing learning experiences. In economics courses, you `do` economics; in history courses, you `do` history, and so on. The same is true in your Personal Learning Challenges. If you don't do the thing you are trying to learn, whether it is a cognitive skill in a particular domain of knowledge, a kinesthetic skill in a sport or in playing a musical instrument, or an affective skill in relating to or understanding yourself and your social world. If you want to improve, you must do the thing.

The second thing to note is the idea that there is a difference between `surface` and `deep` approaches to learning. A surface approach is characterized by learners doing the minimum amount of work  and using low level cognitive skills (memorization, etc) when high level cognitive skills (evaluating, assessing, critiquing) are required. A deep approach is characterized by learners using high level cognitive skills for activities which require them.

The final thing that you should take away from the videos is the importance of `constructive alignment`. Constructive alignment exists when the goals or outcomes of a given learning experience are aligned with the method to be used to assess the learning. For an obvious example, if the goal or outcome of a learning experience is for the learner to be able to juggle three balls in a cascade pattern for 30 seconds, but the assessment of the learning is conducted via a multiple guess exam, then there is a distinct lack of alignment. Furthermore, a learner could simply memorize the steps or actions required in order to successfully juggle in a cascade pattern and pass the assessment easily without ever even touching a ball.
