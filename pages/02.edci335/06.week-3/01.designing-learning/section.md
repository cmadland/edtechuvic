At this point in your life, you have worked your way through close to 15 years of formal learning environments. Some of you have experienced little more than a typical classroom with students in rows of desks and a teacher at the front. Others of you have had more varied experiences, perhaps you attended a Science and Technology school with an emphasis on inquiry learning, or maybe an outdoor education school with an emphasis on adventure education, or maybe you were a home-school student. Whatever the case in your history, you have a variety of experiences from which you can draw.

Use the quiz below to let us know the types of learning environments you grew up with. Once we get some answers, I'll publish the anonymized results.

Or, perhaps, you are familiar with this scene from the 1950s, which might be analogous to some teachers who simply throw everything at their students in a way that is far too fast for their students to process. Some people also call this method 'drinking from a fire hose'.

### Lucy and Ethel at the Chocolate Factory

Or, for a more technologically enhanced prediction from the early 1900s, there is this image, produced for the 1900 World's Fair in Paris.
