At this point in your life, you have worked your way through close to 15 years of formal learning environments. Some of you have experienced little more than a typical classroom with students in rows of desks and a teacher at the front. Others of you have had more varied experiences, perhaps you attended a Science and Technology school with an emphasis on inquiry learning, or maybe an outdoor education school with an emphasis on adventure education, or maybe you were a home-school student. Whatever the case in your history, you have a variety of experiences from which you can draw.

Use the quiz below to let us know the types of learning environments you grew up with. Once we get some answers, I'll publish the anonymized results.
